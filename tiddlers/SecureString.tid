! Remarks

SecureString is a string type that provides a measure of security. It tries to avoid storing potentially sensitive strings in process memory as plain text. ([[For limitations, however, see the How secure is SecureString? section.|https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.securestring(v=vs.110).aspx#HowSecure.]])

The maximum length of a SecureString instance is 65,536 characters.
